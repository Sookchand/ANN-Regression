# ANN Regression
This is a solution to a problem involving a neural network that is used to predict the output of a function given two inputs. The function is y=cos(2x1)+cos(3x2). The dataset is generated using 1000 random points between -3 and +3. The neural network is then trained using the dataset and the output is plotted. The model is then tested to see if it can extrapolate beyond the given range.
## Acknowledgements
